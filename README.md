7. Paste your Discord token by copying it and replacing it with "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN".(All the way down in the code)
   - **IMPORTANT:** DO NOT share the token! Others can use this to log into your account.
   - Note that to make it respond to your commands, you will need to keep the application/script window alive as it is what runs the bot to begin with. After you are done with everything, you can safely just close it.
